# For**** SNU******2D*******ProgrammingTools*******IDE******PDoublePrime
# About****
# I decided to make PDoublePrime the main project language file for this project *****SNU ****** 2D ****** Programming Tools ****** IDE ****** PDoublePrime***** as this is a PDoublePrime IDE* and it needs its main language to be represented here**
# Also* there is no way I am writing something like this in actual PDoublePrime right now* I am only using comments* All commas and periods got replaced with a * to prevent this from being recognized as anything but source code comments* All hyphens were also removed for the same reason**

# Commas* Hyphens* Periods* Backslashes* Parantheses* and Colons have been replaced with Asterisks as to avoid confusion for a future compiler***friendly version**
# 1 asterisk equals comma
# 2 asterisks equals period
# 3 asterisks equals hyphen
# 4 asterisks equals colon
# 5 asterisks equals parantheses *****either left or right*****
# 6 asterisks equals backslash
# Currently* the whole file functions as a comment block* as no valid P′′ source code is present**
